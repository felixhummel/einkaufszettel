# Einkaufszettel Progress

## What Works
- ✅ Core domain models (Item, Zettel) with dataclass implementation
- ✅ Django ORM models with proper relationships and constraints
- ✅ Complete REST API endpoints for:
  - Shopping list management (create, read, update, delete, list)
  - Item management (create, read, update, delete, list, toggle)
  - Bulk operations (create multiple items, complete/uncomplete all)
- ✅ Markdown export functionality
- ✅ Slug-based URL routing
- ✅ Database migrations implemented
- ✅ Basic admin interface available
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage

## What's Left to Build
- ⏳ Enhanced admin interface features
- ⏳ Authentication and authorization system
- ⏳ Multi-tenant isolation mechanisms
- ⏳ Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
- ⏳ Integration with external shopping platforms
- ⏳ Mobile-optimized API responses
- ⏳ Additional unit conversion utilities

## Current Status
The project is in a functional state with:
- Complete API implementation for core shopping list operations
- Working domain model to persistence model bridge
- Proper database schema with uniqueness constraints
- Markdown generation working for both completed and incomplete items

## Known Issues
- ⚠️ Single-tenant focus may need expansion for multi-user scenarios
- ⚠️ API-only approach limits traditional web interface options
- ⚠️ Unicode slug handling may need additional testing
- ⚠️ Bulk operation error handling could be enhanced

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Initial Implementation**: Basic models and API endpoints
2. **Slug Addition**: Improved URL routing and resource identification
3. **Migration Strategy**: Clean database evolution path established
4. **Domain Separation**: Clear distinction between business logic and persistence
5. **Bulk Operations**: Added for API efficiency improvements
6. **Markdown Export**: Included as sharing mechanism

## Testing Status
- ✅ Unit tests implemented
- ✅ 100% coverage requirement met
- ✅ API endpoint testing in place
- ✅ Domain model testing completed
