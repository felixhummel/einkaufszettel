# Einkaufszettel Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Einkaufszettel was created to demonstrate how to manage shopping lists programmatically using Python. It serves as both a practical tool for shopping list management and an educational example of modern Python web development practices.

## Problems It Solves
- **Digital Shopping List Management**: Provides a structured way to manage shopping items with quantities and units
- **API-First Approach**: Enables integration with other applications and services
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Shows how to separate business logic from persistence concerns
- **Markdown Export**: Allows easy sharing and printing of shopping lists in a readable format

## Target Users
- Developers learning Django and Django Ninja
- Users who want to manage shopping lists programmatically
- Applications that need shopping list functionality via API

## User Experience Goals
- Simple and intuitive API endpoints
- Consistent data representation across programmatic and web interfaces
- Reliable CRUD operations for shopping lists and items
- Easy markdown export for sharing/shopping
- Clear completion status tracking for items

## Core Workflows
1. **Create Shopping List**: Initialize a new Zettel with a name
2. **Add Items**: Append items with optional quantities and units
3. **Manage Completion**: Toggle items between completed/incomplete states
4. **View Lists**: Access shopping lists via API or markdown format
5. **Bulk Operations**: Add multiple items or mark all items as completed
