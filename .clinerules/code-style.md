You can find
- source code in `src/`
- tests in `tests/`

Rules:

1. you MUST verify changes by running `make`
2. you MUST NOT write migrations by hand. Use `./manage.py makemigrations` instead.
3. you SHOULD adhere to the following code style
    - keep things DRY (don't repeat yourself)
    - refactor where possible. verify after each step.
